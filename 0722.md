She suggested going for a walk.
He denied causing the accident.

I'm trying to concentrate. Please stop `making`  so much noise.
I enjoy `listing` to music.
I considered `trying` for the job, but in the end I decided against it.
Have you finished `reading` the newspaper yet?
It's better to avoid `traveling` during the rush hour.
My memory is getting worse. I keep `forgetting` things.
If you gamble, you risk `losing`  your money.
Would you mind not interrupting me all the time? Let me speak!

We can take masks to avoid being transmitted through droplet.
I suggest staying in home or going to beach.
The risk is high. If you don't take masks at street.
I might not have dinner. Because I might work overtime.
