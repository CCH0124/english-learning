## I have done 和 I did

使用現在完成式來敘述敘述對現在會產生影響的過去動作。和過去的時間(yesterday, last week 等)合用時，只能用過去簡單式。

| 時間焦點      | **從過去到現在的結果或經驗**                            | **明確的過去時間點**                                |
| 句子是否連接現在？ | ✅ 是，表示影響持續到現在                               | ❌ 否，事情已結束                                   |

just = a short time ago. 剛剛、一會而以前
already = before you except/before I except 已經；比預期的早
